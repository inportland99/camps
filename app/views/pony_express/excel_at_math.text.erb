The Perfect Complement to School

Our classes pick up where school leaves off. Our math classes teach strategies that complement what students learn in school and help them develop better number sense and problem solving skills. Most elementary and middle schools lack STEM classes, so Math Plus Academy provides robotics, programming, math teams, and chess classes for kids who have a natural passion in these areas.
