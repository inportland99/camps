As you know, Math Plus Academy summer camps are a great way to engage your child’s
mind during the summer. At the end of camp, proactive parents like you may wonder
how your child will keep the momentum going.

That's where our year-round enrichment programs come in. We offer weekly classes
for students to build on their camp experience and further develop their math,
problem solving, and engineering skills.This is one of the many things that
separates Math Plus Academy from the other summer camp vendors -- they disappear
once camp is over.

All of our classes are taught by certified teachers who love math and science.
And just like our camps, they are a lot of fun. You can be assured that your child
will enjoy learning new things all year long.

See below for recommendations for year-round enrichment based on the summer camp
that your child attends this week.
