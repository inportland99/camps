    "<strong>He’s doing camps all over Columbus every week this summer and this was his favorite.</strong>"

  <blockquote>
    "<strong>The camps are small and the instructors' enthusiasm and positive attitude is very catching.</strong> It was a beneficial experience for both my boys. One was in a math rut after a year of quickchecks and envision (Dublin's math program), and the other is easily intimidated by math. <strong>They were so involved and excited, that they hardly noticed that they were being challenged.</strong> They are eager to go back for more!""

  <blockquote>
    "The Math Plus SCRATCH programming camp really opened my son's eyes to an entirely new field. <strong>He came home so excited about programming and I could tell he was applying new logic and problem solving skills.</strong> He continues to write new programs at home after the camp. Thanks Math Plus for inspiring him!""
