  <h1>Answers to Frequently Asked Questions...</h1>
  <h3>Do you offer a money-back guarantee?</h3>
  <p>
    We are the only camp that offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If your child attends camp and doesn't like it, we will provide a full refund! (We've served over 1,000 students and never had to issue a refund.)
  </p>
  <h3>If needed, can I switch my camp enrollment to another time?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! As long as we have availability, you can switch your enrollment to another camp at no charge. You'll just need to call us to make the change. <em>Once a camp is scheduled, it may not be canceled.</em>
  </p>
  <h3>Do you offer Girls Only camps?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! We believe that some girls benefit greatly from being in a class with like-minded peers. We offer girls only camps to help inspire and empower the next generation of female scientists, engineers, and inventors.

  <h3>What is the typical daily camp agenda?</h3>
  <p>
    The typical schedule features hands-on activity, challenges, and games designed to spark your child's creativity and excitement. Students work individually and in pairs throughout the day. Students are given 15 minutes breaks throughout the day and are provided water and healthy snacks.<br />
    For kids that do a morning and afternoon camp or a full day camp, we take a 30 minute break for lunch. Lunch is supervised, however, students must bring their own lunch.

    Most of our instructors are certified math teachers. For robotics and computer programming, we often use experienced engineers. All of the insctuctors love math and science and have a passion for inspiring young minds. In addition, they have passed background checks and received extensive training from Math Plus Academy.

  <h3>Whatâ€™s the difference between LEGO engineering &amp; LEGO robotics</h3>
  <p>The LEGO engineering camp is a perfect fit for younger kids (ages 6 - 8) that love LEGOs and science. They will learn about simple machines like levers and pulleys and much, much more.<br /> LEGO Robotics is for older students (ages 9 - 14) and incorporates the LEGO Mindstorms NXT and EV3 robots. Students build and program robots to complete fun challenges.</p>

  <h3>What's the difference between Programming with SCRATCH and Video Game Design?</h3>
  <p>Both camps will focus on using software to create games and animations. SCRATCH camp is a better for kids who really want to learn to code. Video game design campers will not do programming, but will get to exercise their creativity to create professional quality games by the end of the week.</p>

  <h3>Do you offer more advanced programming camps</h3>
  <p>For students that want to go beyond SCRATCH programming, we recommend they join our ongoing programming labs. <a href="https://www.mathplusacademy.com/classes/computer-programming">Click here to learn more about Programming Lab</a></p>
